Many businesses provide services that cannot have an upfront price, as the costs involved can vary. This can be due to the materials that would be used (which can differ depending on the individual needs of the customer), and the manpower that would be necessary. Therefore, it is common practice for these companies to provide the potential customer with a quote (or estimate) of how much it should cost. </p>\n<p>This quotation will be made by the company using the information that the potential customer provides, regarding the relevant elements that may affect the price.
